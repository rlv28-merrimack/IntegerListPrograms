# LinkedListofInetgers
#
# The aim of this program is to take user input of integers. It checks that each
# value inputed is an integer. The program continues until the user enter "No" or 
# "no". 
# 
# The program sorts the given list of integers and creates a Linked List.
# 
# The program prints the sorted Linked List.
# 
# =================================================================================
#
# In order to compile and run the program use the following commands:
#
# Compile Java classes
#
# LinkedListofIntegers.java: implements the entire program
# To compile:

javac LinkedListofIntegers.java

# To run:
#
java LinkedListofIntegers.java

# =================================================================================

# Note on code reuse: 
# Code was generated with the use of Google AI. Of note, the code within the first 
# while loop in the main function, lines 22-35, were generated by Google AI when
# asked how to check that user input is an integer. This code was then adapted by 
# me into a while loop to continually ask for input until "no" or "No" is 
# entered by the user. The idea and codeto create an ArrayList, sort it and then 
# turn into a LinkedList was generated by Google AI and then edited into pieces by
# me.
# Code was also resued in the form of package usage. Packages from java util were used
# to perform functions so as not to "reinvent the wheel."
