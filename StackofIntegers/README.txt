# StackofInetgers
#
# The aim of this program is to take user input of integers. It checks that each
# value inputed is an integer. The program continues until the user enter "No" or 
# "no". 
# 
# The program sorts the given list of integers and creates a Stack.
# 
# The program prints the Stack.
# 
# =================================================================================
#
# In order to compile and run the program use the following commands:
#
# StackofIntegers.java: implements the entire program
# To compile:

javac StackofIntegers.java

# To run:
#
java StackofIntegers.java

# =================================================================================
#
# To run javadocs:
# 
javadoc StackofIntegers.java

#
# Note on code reuse and refactor: 
# Code was resused from LinkedListofIntegers, which included the use of Google AI
# and the utils collection. 
#
# This code was edited from LinkedListofIntegers by removing the lines that created 
# the linked list and replaced with the for loop adding each integer to the stack.
#
# File name and class were renamed as StackofIntegers to be more accurate to the new output.
#
# Additional comments and JavaDocs comments were added.
