# IntegerListPrograms
This repository includes two sets of java code that take integers as inputs, sorts the list of integers, and returns as either a stack or a linked list.

The repository contains two folders-LinkedListofIntegers and StackofIntegers.

[LinkedListofIntegers](/LinkedListofIntegers/) includes:
  [Java file](/LinkedListofIntegers/LinkedListofIntegers.java/) with code to take user input of integers, sort and return as a linked list.
  [README](/LinkedListofIntegers/README.txt/) file about how to compile program as well as the coding logic used.
  [Javadoc](/LinkedListofIntegers/LinkedListofIntegers.html/) file containining the help documentation.

[StackofIntegers](/StackofIntegers/) includes:
  [Java file](/StackofIntegers/StackofIntegers.java/) with code to take user input of integers, sort and return as a stack.
  [README](/StackofIntegers/README.txt/) file about how to compile program as well as the coding logic used.
  [Javadoc](/StackofIntegers/StackofIntegers.html/) file containining the help documentation.
